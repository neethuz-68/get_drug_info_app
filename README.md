### Project Description
This Streamlit app lets users identify medicines from images and get drug information.  Users upload an image of a pill or medicine bottle. The app uses Google's Gemini API to identify the drug and then provides details about its usage and potential side effects. 

### The Problem statement
This project solves the problem of "What is this pill I found?" or "I can't read the tiny print on this bottle!"  It tackles the everyday frustration of trying to identify medications when the labeling is unclear, missing, or you're just plain forgetful.

### The Solution
while it might not cure any diseases, it can cure the mild panic of "I have no idea what this is, and I don't want to accidentally take the wrong thing!"  It's a small solution to a surprisingly widespread problem.  It's the digital equivalent of asking a friend, "Hey, do you know what this pill is?" but with the added benefit of (hopefully) accurate information.

## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used
For Software:
- Python, Markdown
- Streamlit 
- google.generativeai, Pillow (PIL): The Python Imaging Library, io, json, re, base64
- 1. Programming Languages:Python
2. Libraries/Modules:google.generativeai, Pillow (PIL): The Python Imaging Library, io, json, re, base64

Streamlit: The web framework for creating the user interface. ¬† 
google.generativeai: The Google Generative AI library for interacting with the Gemini API. ¬† 
Pillow (PIL): For image processing.
io: For handling image data in memory.
json: For working with JSON data (API responses).
re: For regular expressions (used in parsing). ¬† 
base64: For encoding image data. ¬† 
3. Development Tools:A code editor like VS Code, Git, Command line.

 
Git: A version control system (like Git) is highly recommended for managing the project's code and collaborating with others (if applicable). Platforms like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket are commonly used to host Git repositories.
Command-Line Interface (CLI): The command line or terminal is used for running Streamlit (streamlit run your_app.py), installing packages (pip install -r requirements.txt), and working with Git.
4. Deployment Tools: Streamlit Cloud
5. API: Gemini API
